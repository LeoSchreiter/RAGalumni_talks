# RoboterAG Alumni Knowledge Hub  

A collection of math and physics concepts taught by former [RoboterAG]([https://www.bzm-gy.de/lernen/robotics-und-sia]) members to help pupils transition from school to university-level STEM.  

## Contents  

- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus
- **Physics**: Mechanics, electromagnetism
- **Code**: Python/C++ examples with Jupyter notebooks  

## Quick Start  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/roboterag-alumni.git
```  

Browse by topic:  
- `/math` – Vectors, matrices, derivatives  
- `/physics` – Classical physics  

## Why This Exists  

We simplify university-level concepts with:  
✔ Visual explanations  
✔ Practical code demos  
✔ Exercises with solutions
